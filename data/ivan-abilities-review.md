# Bubblegum

### Infinite inflation
Pretty strong card you can use all skills in a turn, and you don't even need to be THAT lucky. Last damage dealt means any damage dealt, so I could attack you with 3 dmg, gain 2 shield and then use the last skill to get 3 more shield. You're down 3 health and I'm up 5 shield for 3 dice.
>> It's very strong but not that exciting.

### POP!
More boring than infinite inflation, it would probably feel good because you do 4 damage nearly every turn. Damage, damage, gain shield, trade shield for dice manipulation. The last two obviously combo, which is cool. 
>>  It woudln't feel bad having this card, but it's not exciting either.

### Vulcanize
Now this feels like it could combo with other stuff. The 6 shield is probably from when we had 3 creatures... I don't know if I would remove it though. You would also get 6 damage, but maybe you can combo your way out of it. However, you can just attack and then lose the shield, which shouldn't be the easy way out. Perhaps this shield should stay despite attack, but then it can drag the game out.
>> It was fun writing about the card, so it would probably be fun to play. It would probably feel unfair in this current state.

### Stretched Taut
Sounds like insane combo potential. It looks well balanced: not much attack unless you go into the theme of the card which is shield. The more shield you go, the more benefits because you might get a new die. Two infinities though? Probably because once you attack you lose the shield.
>> Sounds very interesting. I like it.

### Handy plasticity
Sounds like a support card. Doesn't sound like you can do much more than what's on the card though. Maybe there's some cool combo where you can get a creature to 3 fortitude fast, but 3 fortitude actually sounds like a nightmare.
>> Sounds boring

### Bounce back
>>Ehhh, I don't know. Sounds mediocre. It's not boring per se, it just feels like too much to keep track of.

### Will to live
I think it's interesting. Can create fun situations, but it might feel unfair. Sounds like cool ult though. However, what happens when I give a creature +1 strength, it dies, and I revive it. Does it still have +1 strength? 
>> I like it, but doesn't sound like combo potential?

### Bubble trouble
You might be stuck doing 0 damage for a turn with this one. But it sounds cool enough with the increment and gaining shield by dealing damage. For example, you can choose your own, some radioactive creature that deals 4 times 1 damage, you get 4 shield. 4 damage plus 4 damage, pretty strong but earned. Two priority.
>> Sounds like it could make cool plays.

### Candy coat
Boring, seen before. The only thing that could be cool is taking the opponents shield, but even that is pretty weaksauce.
>> boring

### Candy bash
It sounds flexible and that you could combo (with an additional card) to do insane damage every turn. 
>>I don't know, sounds fine, but something bothers me with this card, though I can't say what.

### Conclusion
I am tired of shield mechanics after going through them all just now. Bubblegum relies basically only on shield as its thing, at least within abilities. Knowing what I know now, I would avoid bubblegum Zvery because I'd be afraid I'll get a really mediocre ability. The few cool ones woulnd't really justify the risk. However, support should be reliable, maybe bubblegum is just supposed to be support and have only the occasional banger ability. (I don't think that's the case.)

# Crystal

### All out offense 
As the name implies it is quite offensive. Doesn't do much apart from comboing with itself, you can do 8 damage by taking 4 that's pretty strong and by then you'll have only used 2 dice. So you can pretty much one shot a lot of creatures. Considering combos, the best part is that you damage yourself, which seems like an opportunity to do something out of the box 
>> It seems pretty limited in possibility it seems, but insanely strong, which is cool in and of itself. But after you get a few mutations you'll really have one of the highest damage outputs probably

### Windbreaker
Boringly op counterattack. Why do you get 2 dice for getting damaged? That sounds very strong. I guess you signal the enemy to avoid attacking you, but that kind of goes against the first skill. I mean the first skill can also just be useless when they attack you with 1DMG, especially a radioactive Zvery. Doesn't feel very harmonious as a standalone ability.
>> Not a fan

### Energetic restructuring
Doesn't sound as strong as the others, but it's very interesting because you get to play with a die. Needs some commas and rephrasing perhaps. I like that you can attack yourself by doubling another Zvery's attack to get strength +1. 
>> Sounds interesting, I'd like to play with it.

### Crystalleye
The shatter is fun, but the rest is just boring. There's not much to this card, unless you have a Zvery that gets triggered when you shatter something.
>> 1 cool skill, otherwise miss me

### Fractured wrap
Well, I would feel terrible if my opponent had Crystalleye where they get to shatter for damaging themselves by 2, and I spent two dice to shatter one unused. Cool ult though. 
>> Doesn't really bring the excitement for me

### Splintering impact
Again a cheaper shatter. A lot of damage output, but also subpar. Interesting with the damage for attacking it, but I don't see something cool I could do with that except for...damage(!)
>> Again just damage, boring

###  Crystallize
I think the skill with +1 fortitude is cool. Maybe it shouldn't be fortitude but strength, because fortitude is a nightmare to play against. Add to that the shield... On the other hand, it might be improved by giving another skill which uses the fortitude to do something cooler. Conceptually, it crystallizes then it shatters that to do something. For example, 1 dice: - 1 fortitude, shatter used die.' Add an ult that is activated with 6 dice or something. 
>>  Sounds annoying to have and might be annoying to play against.

### Mirroring minerals
>> Simple, but really cool because it offers a lot of potential variety. 

### Carbonado finish
>> Super strong with a lot of damage output potentially, but boring. The fortitude is also random.

### Cairgroom morningstar
The double damage for this combat is interesting and can be applied really diversely. The destroy a creatures shield sounds useless though for 8 powerup. Otherwise it's ok. Doesn't really have damage output otherwise. 
>> I actually ilke this one.

### Conclusion
I get that the concept is damage, but I don't like it when there are two skills that only deal damage. I think crystal has some gems(!), that we could take further to make some really insane abilities. Overall, there were definitely some skills that made me excited to use them, but usually the whole ability seems to lack.

# Plasma

### Supercharge
>>I think this is a good ability. It offers some variety without relying only on damage, but it makes it possible to pop off with some mutations.

### Fluctuating charge
>> Boring ability with cool last skill. I think it spices up the average round, but overall not a fan of the ability. 

### Friction welding
Two fuse mechanics seems a lot and not really useful or fun. I like the fuse exactly 6 then stun 1, because you get a die you maybe need and do something by the way. The last skill is ok, but it raised an eyebrow.
>> I think this ability is confusing interesting with fun.

### Down the current
Like Supercharge I like that it offers so many possibilities. The second skill really puts the pressure on the opponent, and it might be used as a bluffing strategy. But it might turn out really weak as an ability. It uses a lot of dice overall and doesn't really deal crazy damage if you don't get the 5 damage combo. Powerup 7 to fuse 2 dice seems weak.
>> Somehow it seems fine overall because you can go crazy with mutations

### Frantic overload
Cool, but it has a similar skill twice, what if it inverted the second. Remove all stun give -1 fortitude. Or something else in place of one of the two damage skills.
>> Overall fine. 

### Pole reversal
>> Gimmicky and maybe too strong without being particularly fun

### ZZZZZZZ!
>> Really cool and I like that it uses the turnorder. 

### Thunder
Interesting mechanic because it goes deeper into that gambling feeling that Zvery already does well, but two skills is maybe too much. It's cool that you can affect the roll by stunning an opponent. 
>> Sounds fun but needs a little work

### Short-circuit
>> I think it's pretty solid.

### Pure energy
>> Really whacky ability, I like it

### Conclusion
I think the abilities here are better on average than Crystal and Bubblegum. I assume it's because fuse and stun are just more fun than increment and shield, and crystal's lack of some signature thing. It immediately opens up possibilities to do fun things to which you can work towards. And even when an ability has two damage skills it doesn't feels so boring.

# Radioactive

### Energetic overflow
>> Seems like a good fit for radioactive, but it does feel like it does a little too much damage to itself. The third skill could be something different-maybe dice manipulation.

### Controlled explosion
>> I think this is great, it has a clear strategy, but can still be flexible because you're manipulating dice.

### Psychonautics
>> Pretty cool, setting dice seems strong, but fun.

### Super-Gau
>> I think it's cool, because it does everything. Cool ult, offers some dice manip, has a gamble, and damage.

### Destructive shutdown
I think it has a cool premise, but relies on another card for the last skill. Otherwise, you'll be dealing max 2 damage with the last ability. This isn't necessarily bad, we have a few abilitites that sound like they could be powerful only when combined, which doesn't mean we need to rework them.
>> I think it's good enough.

### Atomic split
I like the interaction with the infinity decrement and deal one dmg for every 1. The damage negate seems random without something it works with, of course it's powerful in and of itself which is cool.
>> Good enough.

### Precise time
>> Cool use of turnorder, sounds like it could be fun

### Experimental fusion
>> Like. A lot of possibilitie with the heart switch and the double target. And it's strong nonetheless.

### Accelerated decay
Interesting because it changes the nature of the game. You're bound to hit someone for 8 which can be lethal and you might be able to go back to 4. It feels like it creates a new approach to the round when this is in play because it can really shorten the whole thing.
>> Interesting, I like it

### Boundless destruction
>> I think it's cool

### Conclusion
This was definitely the most fun up to now. I think these abilities really get the point of radioactive across, there's some really cool mechanics in here. Of course we can push it further but these really show a good example. My impression is that these abilities work well within themselves but still offer opportunities for outside combinations.

# Void

### Interdimensional Rift
I like the interactive element, but I think it would feel unfair from the perspective of the opponent that you get 2 dice for 1. The switching of the unused die is fine. 
>> I want to give players overpowered things to play with, but this kinda seems like it would snowball

### The other side
I hate "cannot be targeted" effects. I think they aren't fun because the other player doesn't get to play (especially in a wild battle when this appears on the wild). Apart from that, I really like the card. The possibility of copying another's trait is just exciting to think about, and copying the dice manipulation seems also fun.
>> I would only replace the last skill

### Banish
Fucks with your opponent, but not in an unfair way. Your reroll might actually give them something better, and the blockage of X value skills isn't that big a deal. But it is also very useful for comboing with the setting two dice skill. Might do 5 damage in a turn.
>> Great!

### Time leap
>> I think it's cool

### Time force
Very similar to time leap, feels weird to have two conceptually that similar cards. I think it's also more powerful because you get to take as many dice as you want without the opponent being able to stop it. 
>> I think it's too strong and too similar to time leap

### Gravitational pull
>> Good support ability that can deal a lot of damage the roundabout way

### Assorted darkness
>> The last skill reminds me of another card, but it does one damage more. Overall, I like the board control of this card.

### Empty winds
>> Sounds strong, but not really exciting

### Past blast
Remove from play sucks, but at least it is hard to get and unusable the next turn, so it feels a bit more justified. 
>> Speaking from experience, it's pretty fun

### Beam cannon
>> Interesting first and last skill, but the two damage skills kinda make it meh in the end. Good enough I guess

### Conclusion
Void seems like it has become boardcontrol, which is actually a cool aspect I hadn't considered before. There are some really cool mechanics here, but sometimes the cards feel like they miss that little something to make them really great. Overall, I like the abilities.

# Overall conclusion
If I had to rank the typings for what I consider best to worst: radioactive > void > plasma > bubblegum > crystal.
Radioactive really stands out to me because when I read an ability I feel excited with the amount of possibilities I potentially have to combo off of. Void is a close second because the mechanics sound fun, and I think what elevates these two is that they probably have the most dice manipulation. I remember we decided to make the traits manipulate the dice, and the abilities just use the dice. I wouldn't want to add dice abilites to traits, but I would like to add more manipulations to all the cards. I think it's the most fun thing that unlocks the really cool plays. 
Additionally, radioactive, void, and plasma feel like they have interesting identities, whereas bubblegum just feels generic. Crystal doesn't have one at all. Maybe I shouldn't be chewing out bubblegum that much, because they do have some potentially interesting interactions with shield. But then again, it feels like every ability does something with shield, while the other typings usually do something different. Crystal of course, just does damage, which isn't bad per se, but it shouldn't be the whole identity. 
If we start reworking, I think we need to start with crystal and try to hammer out something that makes it different and worthwhile as a type.
